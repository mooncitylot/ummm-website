        <b>Emphasize Simplicity and Value.</b> At UMMM Software we are hunting for simple no-nonsense solutions. 
        What we do is build software that gets you your time and money back.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Use Boring Technology.</b>
        We know the buzzwords (AI, Cloud, Blockchain) and how to use them, but we will always
        lead with questions about your needs and the needs of your customers, not our tech stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Find The Right Scale.</b>
        It's tempting to always scale to the highest degree. And sometimes what you need <em>is</em>
        a large integrated system. But often the most bang for your buck comes from automating something small, 
        turning a fifteen minute task that you do 20 times a day into a one time button click. Large or small scale, 
        we love building both. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Make Software For People.</b> At the heart of our work is a commitment to helping people stay human. 
        Software can be a help or a hindrance. And there is a lot of software at the moment that is incompetently
        or maliciously interested in numbers of people. 
      </p>
        <p>We believe that software designed to be helpful to its end
        users is the most profitable in the long run. So whether it's handling user data, designing client applications, 
        or working with your team, we will always be asking hard question about what it means for the well being of your users.

    <h2>Housing Reentry App</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 500px">
      When the ever innovative Elkhart County Jail ministry started their reentry housing program, they decided
      to pair that with a web application to help keep their tenants informed and connected. We were excited to partner 
      with them to provide a portal to initially access their lease, account, as well as announcements and community events.
    </p> 
    <p style="max-width: 500px">
      As both a service to their tenants and gift to the community, they also asked us to 
      make a local directory of available of resources such as emergency food and housing assistance. 
      As users of the app are often accessing this app in moments of insecurity we streamlined the process of finding
      the information they need most.
    </p> 
    <p style="max-width: 500px">
      This web based application is installable on mobile device home screens with a look and feel like a native IOS or Android application with device data caching and offline capabilities.
